# How Is This Course Structured?

This course is split into two parts.
The first part introduces CAPI with its core concepts.
The second part dives into extended functionality
such as the management of clusters using GitOps.

Each section contains examples formulated as challenges to make it possible to deepen your undestanding of CAPI.
